# Chercher Metasearch Engine

## Project overview:
Chercher (to search in French) is a simple meta-search engine,
intended for personal use.

Project goal:
- Able to integrate with several search engine 
  - Kagi (because I use Kagi)
  - DuckDuckGo
- Search for other sources
  - Local file
  - Database
    - SQL
    - MongoDB, Cassandra
    - ElasticSearch, MeiliSearch
- API Based Searching (any API at all)

Understandably, Golang is not very easy to extend. 
The application will not be written for extendability in mind 
(I'm using this just as an opportunity to practice Golang).
